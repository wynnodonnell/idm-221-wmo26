About me:
=
I am a student at Drexel University in the Interactive Digital Media program. I transferred into IDM from computer science after doing one year and finding myself wanting to design a lot more than I wanted to code. I switched into IDM and have been thriving ever since. I'm able to express myself artistically and creatively in ways I wasn't able to in computer science.

I'm originally from Seattle Washington. I came to Philadelphia because I wanted to get away from my comfort zone, and go somewhere that I could find out more about myself. I've found that Philadelphia has a lot more to offer than people give it credit for, and it gets a lot of hate that it doesn't deserve. 

As a designer I want to go into User Experience design. I've always enjoyed the more personal elements that go into research for UX, and I want to explore the reasons behind why people do things. The UI design part of building websites is also interesting to me, but it doesn't give me the same vigor that UX does.

In my free time I love listening to books on tape, walking around the city (skateboarding when I can), playing video games, or going rockclimbing. I like to have my own personal adventures, and go places that I never thought I'd end up, which is really why I'm in Philly, but I don't regret it even for a second. Seattle still feels like home to me, but every day I spend in Philadelphia makes it feel more and more like it's home also.
