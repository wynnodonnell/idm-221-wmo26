I like Van Schneider's portfolio website a lot, even though my laptop is a bit too small for the way the site is designed. As I scroll through the website the theme changes, which is what I love about this site. I'm not just stuck with some static minimalist design, I get to experience multiple color schemes, while still having some constistancy across the board. With each art piece that he presents you get a color profile to match that piece. Also as a side note he created honest weather which is wonderfully designed, and funny besides.

There are some things that I dislike about his site. For one, the header that follows me around while I scroll down the page is terrible, mostly cause it disappears when the background is white, and it overlays everything instead of having its own solid backing. His about page isn't my favorite either; he's got one image, and then all the text is pushed off to one side, which would work if the image went all the way down to where the text stopped, or if he had more than one image, but it doesn't and he didnt, and the entire about page is scewed heavily to the right because of it.

So at this point you can probably tell there is a theme, I'm looking at portfolio websites, because that's what we're doing for this project. Tom Biskup takes a totally different approch to his portfolio, it isn't nearly as flashy or in your face as Van Schneider's, but I think that's what makes it great. At the very top of his home page he has a running display of different pieces from his portfolio, they go by quickly, but almost all of them have a little visial flare so it's hard to miss them. As you start to scroll down you get a little bio, telling you what he does and where he is, but not much more than that, which I like, it gives you a feel for what he does, without overwhelming you with text before you click on the about page. Below that is one of my favorite parts about the site, just a few gifs that showcase his work brilliantly. They are laid out like picture frames on a wall, and I love it, they are all clickable, and when clicked on they bring you to the project page for that specific work.

I love Biskup's about page as well, it's a simple image of him, and text next to it, that doesn't go past the bottom of the image. I also like his menu design, instead of having that travelling bar like Van Schneider does Biscup has a collapsable menu, and I would want to implement something similar the one that he has.

Kyle Decker's portfolio site is much more simplified than Van Schneider's or Biskups. When you go onto his page you see a short description, and one of his projects, which you can interact with. If you scroll down you see four boxes, which serve as glorified links, three for projects he's worked on, and one for his about page. I love this design, very simple, very neat, yet it still showcases very well what he does, and shows examples of that work. 

What I don't like about Decker's design is with his lack of visuals. I scroll down and I see text descriptions in these boxes of what the project that's linked is, but there aren't any concrete pictures of the project until after you click on the link. If I were to use a design similar to this I would add more visuals to each of the projects linked at the bottom of the page.
