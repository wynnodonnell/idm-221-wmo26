                Hi. I am a student at Drexel University in the Interactive Digital Media program. I transferred in after one year of computer science, having found myself wanting to design a lot more than I wanted to code. I'm able to express myself artistically and creatively in ways I wasn't able to in computer science.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm originally from Seattle Washington. I came to Philadelphia because I wanted to get away from my comfort zone, and go somewhere that I could find out more about myself. I've found that Philadelphia has a lot more to offer than people give it credit for, and it gets a lot of hate that it doesn't deserve.
             </p>
             <p>
                As a designer I want to go into User Experience design. I've always enjoyed the more personal elements that go into research for UX, and I want to explore the reasons behind why people do things. I want to pick the minds of the people around me and figure out what makes them tick.
             </p>
             <p>
                In my free time I love listening to books on tape, walking, biking, or skateboarding around the city, playing video games, or taking photos. I like to have my own personal adventures, and to go places that I never thought I'd end up, which is really why I'm in Philly, but I don't regret it even for a second. Seattle still feels like home to me, but every day I spend in Philadelphia makes it feel more and more like it's home also.
             </p>
