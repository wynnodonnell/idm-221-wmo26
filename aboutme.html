                Hi. I am a student at Drexel University in the Interactive Digital Media program. I transferred in after one year of computer science, having found myself wanting to design a lot more than I wanted to code. I'm able to express myself artistically and creatively in ways I wasn't able to in computer science.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm originally from Seattle Washington. I came to Philadelphia because I wanted to get away from my comfort zone, and go somewhere that I could find out more about myself. I've found that Philadelphia has a lot more to offer than people give it credit for, and it gets a lot of hate that it doesn't deserve.
             </p>
             <p>
                As a designer I want to go into User Experience design. I've always enjoyed the more personal elements that go into research for UX, and I want to explore the reasons behind why people do things. I want to pick the minds of the people around me and figure out what makes them tick.
             </p>
             <p>
                 At Drexel I am the president of a student organization called Drexel Student Power Network. I have been a part of the organization since April of 2018, and took up a leadership role in April of 2019. As a group we try to keep the administration at Drexel in check for the choices they make in our community, and inform the Drexel student population of things that the administration is up to that they might disagree with.
             </p>
             <p>
                In my free time I love listening to books on tape, walking, biking, or skateboarding around the city, playing video games, or taking photos. I like to have my own personal adventures, and to go places that I never thought I'd end up, which is really why I'm in Philly, but I don't regret it even for a second. Seattle still feels like home to me, but every day I spend in Philadelphia makes it feel more and more like it's also home.
